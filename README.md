Project: MinidroneCompetition

Team UGV DTU's entry for Mathworks Minidrone Competition - EMEA 2021. It demonstrates how Simulink(R) is used to model the PARROT Mambo Minidrone. The algorithm can be directly deployed on the Parrot Mambo hardware using the Simulink Support Package for Parrot Minidrones.

If the drone is not above the track while simulating,
run utilities/openTrackBuilder.m and update the virtual world with your own waypoints csv file or feel free to draw your own path by clicking on the whitespace.
